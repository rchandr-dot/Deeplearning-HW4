Homework Description:
This homework requires implementing, training, and analyzing three Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models—DCGAN, WGAN, and ACGAN—on the CIFAR-10 dataset. These models demonstrate different strategies for generating synthetic images and solving GAN-related challenges like mode collapse and training instability

Installation and Testing

Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository_url>


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Notebooks: Use Jupyter Notebook to run the .ipynb files sequentially for training.

Evaluation
Evaluating Model Performance
Use FID (Fréchet Inception Distance) scores to evaluate and compare the quality of images generated by the DCGAN, WGAN, and ACGAN models.
Track FID scores during training to monitor progress and identify the best-performing model. Lower FID scores indicate better image quality and diversity.
